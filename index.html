        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user
          </li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.
          </li>
          <li>The head element in this case defines the following three elements:

            The charset element sets our character encoding.
            
            The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.
            
            The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.
            
            Finally, the title of the webpage is defined.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element, we can use the following metadata tags:

            The (title) element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
            
            The (style) element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
            
            The (base) element defines the base URL for a webpage.
            
            The(link) element connects an external resource to the HTML document.
            
            The (meta) element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
            
            The (script) element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

            A marigin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            and element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on
            the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped
            together, combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a
            comma,
          </li>
          <li>
            text-align: This is one way to center a title or heading on a
            webpage. img selector assigns property values to any image element
            in the markup ul elements declares the font and padding link element
            creates the connection to the external file, rel attribute specifies
            the relationship between the current document and the linked
            document resource,The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of
            the external resource.

          <li>
            Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by
            semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a
            color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. Try selecting a color and
            replace the border color with its hex #, which you can find on this
            HTML Color Codes website https://htmlcolorcodes.com/

            variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in
            our code. To declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the
            var keyword, we give the variable a name. Finally, we use an
            assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want
            stored in our variable. Example "(var shape = "circle")"

            When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file,
            it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If
            it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between
            the curly brackets. If the condition is not true or has a value that
            is not truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between
            the curly brackets and move on.
          </li>
          <li>
            The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are
            equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and
            false if the values are not equal.
